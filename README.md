# PocketLG: Protein Binding Pocket Identification Using Protein Large Language Model and Graph Transformer
This repository contains source code, training models, and data preprocessing code for PocketLG
## Introduction
A protein pocket is a special region on the surface of a protein that is commonly used to interact with other molecules (especially small molecule compounds) for various biological functions. Accurately identifying and understanding the structure of protein pockets can accelerate the development of new drugs and improve existing drugs to reveal disease mechanisms. In this study, we developed a protein data preprocessing tool for sampling the binding domains on the surface of proteins and augmented the sample data to output the data needed for a protein pocket model. And we also propose a deep learning model, PocketLG, to discover which of these samples are binding pockets. Experimental results show that our deep learning model can identify binding pockets on proteins with 91% success rate. This work provides a new technical route for protein binding pocket prediction research, which can greatly contribute to the development of the pharmaceutical industry.
